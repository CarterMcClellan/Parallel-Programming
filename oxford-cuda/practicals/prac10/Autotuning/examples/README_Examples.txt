EXAMPLES

This directory provides a few example programs which can be tuned.

They are descibed in the User's Guide: doc/user.pdf




hello               Simple test case, compiles a 'hello world' program.

laplace3d           A CUDA test case.

looping             Simple test case where parameters control the number of 
                      loop iterations.

maths               Simple test case where parameters are summed using 'expr'. 
                      Uses a custom figure of merit.

matlab              A MATLAB program to determine the optimum level of 
                      'strip-mining' vectorisation.

matrix              Blocked matrix multiplication test case.
    comparison      Compares the blocked and naive implementations.
    modified        The modified, tunable, version, after the changes 
                      from the tutorial.
    original        The original version, not ready for tuning. 
                      Used by the tutorial.
