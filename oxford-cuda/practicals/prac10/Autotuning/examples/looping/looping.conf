# Autotuning System
#
# looping.conf
#
# This configuration file is for testing a simple looping program.
# loop.c is compiled with the two constants XLOOP and YLOOP set by the compiler.
# It is then tested for execution time either by the autotuning system,
# or by a custom FOM, loop_test.sh which uses the time utility.


# The configuration file must contain the following sections:
# [variables], [values], [testing], [scoring], [output] 


[variables]
# Contains a single option: 'variables'
# This lists the variables which will be tuned.
# This can either be a flat list: FOO, BAR, BAZ
# or a nested list, showing independence: {FOO, {BAR1, BAR2}, {BAZ1, BAZ2}}
# This syntax is explained fully in the User's Guide.

#variables = OPTLEVEL, XLOOP, YLOOP
variables = {OPTLEVEL, {XLOOP}, {YLOOP}}



[values]
# Lists the possible values each variable can take, e.g:
# FOO = 1, 2, 3
# BAR = Hello, Welcome, Hi

XLOOP = 5000, 10000, 20000

YLOOP = 12000, 18000

OPTLEVEL = -O0, -funroll-loops



[testing]
# Shows how to compile and run the tests.
# Any of the following commands can use %FOO%, %BAR%, etc. as placeholders for 
# the variables named FOO and BAR which are being tuned.
# %%ID%% gives a unique test ID.


# compile (optional, default: none)
# Shell command to compile a test, typically a call to 'make' or similar.

compile = make -f MakeLoop -B EXEC_NAME=./bin/loop_%%ID%% XLOOP=%XLOOP% YLOOP=%YLOOP% OPTLEVEL=%OPTLEVEL%



# test
# Shell command to run a test.

# For timing by the tuner
test = echo "RUNNING LOOP TEST %%ID%%"; ./bin/loop_%%ID%%

# For custom FOM from loop_test.sh
#test = ./loop_test.sh ./bin/loop_%%ID%%



# clean (optional, default: none)
# Shell command to clean up (e.g. delete) any unwanted test files.

clean = rm ./bin/loop_%%ID%%



[scoring]
# Options for how tests are scored to determine which is best.


# repeat (optional, default: 1, min)
# The number of times a test should be repeated.
# Also specifies how to aggregate the results of repeated tests into one 
# overall score for the test.
# Possible aggregates are: min, max, med, avg.
# If no aggregate is specified, 'min' is used as a default.
# i.e: "repeat = 3, min" and "repeat = 3" are equivalent.

repeat = 3, med


# optimal (optional, default: min_time)
# Whether the highest or lowest score is considered best.
# Can be: min_time, max_time, min, max.
# If the '_time' versions are used, the system times the execution of the 
# 'test' command above and uses that as the score. Otherwise, the score is 
# taken from the last line of output from the 'test' command.

# For timing by the tuner
optimal = max_time
# For custom FOM from loop_test.sh
#optimal = max



[output]
# If defined, this is the name of a CSV file which a log of the tests 
# performed will be written to.
# If not defined, no log will be saved.
# This file will be overwritten!

log = results/looping_log.csv
